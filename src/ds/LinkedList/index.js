/**
 * Linked List
 *
 * A linked list is a data structure that stores multiple values in a linear fashion. Each value in a linked list is contained in its own node, an object that contains the data along with a link to the next node in the list.
 * The link is a pointer to another node object or null if there is no next node.
 * If each node has just one pointer to another node (most frequently called next) then the list is considered a singly linked list (or just linked list) whereas if each node has two links (usually previous and next) then it is considered a doubly linked list.
 *
 * Why use a linked list?
 *
 * The primary benefit of linked lists is that they can contain an arbitrary number of values while using only the amount of memory necessary for those values.
 * Previously (in C/C++) arrays needed to have pre-defined size, which will be used when allocating memory for the array.  One memory-scarce machines, you could easily run out of available memory using arrays. Linked lists were created to work around this problem.
 *
 * Though originally intended for better memory management, linked lists also became popular when developers didnâ€™t know how many items an array would ultimately contain.
 * It was much easier to use a linked list and add values as necessary than it was to accurately guess the maximum number of values an array might contain.
 *
 * The built-in JavaScript Array type is not implemented as a linked list, though its size is dynamic and is always the best option to start with.
