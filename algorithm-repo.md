Repository with algorithms:

1. Is word a palindrome: kayak in reverse letter order is kayak, it's a palindrome. ✓
2. Is an array of characters contain all unique characters. ✓
3. Flatten the array of any depth.
4. Nullify object leafs (apply it on nested objects' leafs as well)
5. Compare arrays of objects.
6. Given two strings, check if one is a permutation of the other.
7. URLify. Replace all the spaces in the string with '%20'.
8. Palindrome permutation: Given a string, chekc if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
9. One Away: There are three edits that can be performed on strings: insert a char, remove a char or replace a char. Given two strings, check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
10. String compression: aabccccaaa = a2b1c4a3. If the compressed string is longer then the original, return the original.
11. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 butes, rotate the image by 90 degrees.
12. Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. How to solve this if a temporary buffer is not allowed? C#
13. Find the k-th to last element of a singly linked list.
14. Delete Middle Node: Delete a node in the middle (any node but not the first or last one) of a singly linked list, given access ony to that node. Given a list, retunr the list without the removed node.
